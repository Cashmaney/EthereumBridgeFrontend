        <ul>
          <li>1) Swap ERC-20s, or Ethereum to Secret Tokens</li>
          <li>
            2) Currently supported tokens: ETH, OCEAN, YFI, UNI, TUSD, SNX, MKR,
            DAI, BAND, LINK, AAVE, COMP, KNC and WBTC.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of volatility of gas prices on Ethereum, the swap transaction
        fee will be shown before the transaction is aproved by the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also do the reverse transfer, i.e., redeem your tokens back to
        your ethereum account. This will cost you SCRT gas, and a fee of about 500K gas,
        in the denomination that is being withdrawn to cover the multisig transaction costs.
